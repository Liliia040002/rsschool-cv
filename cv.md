*****
I am a "switcher". I worked for 6 years at V.N. Karazin Kharkiv University as an associate professor. My main responsibilities were: teaching subjects in oil and gas fields, writing scientific articles, participating in scientific conferences. Now I have completely changed the scope of my activity - I have experience working with 2D design and am actively studying Frontend developer.
